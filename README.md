# Introduction
An open source project for modeling RC Shear Walls using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) Surrogate Model with OpenSeesPy + TensorFlow.
Based on the research paper: An Open-Source Framework for Modeling RC Shear Walls using Deep Neural Networks (publication pending)

# Run the interactive GUI application
To open the GUI to test and visualize the DNN results run the file "AppGUI.py"

# FEM model quick Test
To perform a quick test with the FEM model, run the file "RunValidationExample.py"
