# Introduction
An open source project for modeling RC Shear Walls using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) Surrogate Model with OpenSeesPy + TensorFlow.

# Run the interactive GUI application
To open an interactive GUI to test and visualize the surrogate model results, run the file "AppGUI.py"

# FEM model quick Test
To perform a quick test with the FEM model using OpenSeesPy, run the file "RunValidationExample.py"
